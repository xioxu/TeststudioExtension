# TeststudioExtension

Test studio of telerik is an awesome automation test tool, and it also provides some extension interfaces, so once the officical feature not meet your requirement, it will help you.

So I created this project to maintain what I have done for extension test studio:

1. CustomFileUploadDialog
  The official FileUploadDialog only do exactly match for window caption in their internal window searching, but sometimes we need to use partial search, so I made this plugin.   It has same usage likes FileUploadDialog.
